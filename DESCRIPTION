Description: Sparse additive interaction learning with the strong heredity property, i.e., 
    an interaction is selected only if its corresponding main effects are also included. 
    Fits a linear model with non-linear interactions via penalized maximum likelihood. 
    Interactions are limited to a single exposure or environment variable. For more information, 
    see the website below and the accompanying paper: Bhatnagar et al., "A sparse additive model for 
    high-dimensional interactions with an exposure variable", 2019, <DOI:10.1101/445304>.
